For this project I used the following technologies:
- Node.js
- Express
- Mongodb
- React.js
- Redux
- Webpack
- Babel

This project depends on node.js, mongodb and webpack. You need these installed before proceeding. You also need to create a .env file with your environment configuration, you can copy the .env.sample and change its values.

Run:
```
npm install
```

to install the project dependencies. Then you need to run:
```
webpack
```
to build the project. Make sure to have the mongod daemon running before you run the web server with:
```
npm start
```
then head over to http://localhost:3000 to access the application.
